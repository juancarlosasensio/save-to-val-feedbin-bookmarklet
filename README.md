### What is this?

A simple bookmarklet to save links (and associated notes) to my Feedbin and a Val.Town val.

### Why does it exist?

I think of vals as mortar for my code bricks. In this case, I wanted a bookmarks "feed" on my website, [juancarlosasensio.com]([url](https://juancarlosasensio.com/)), and didn't want to create a whole database for it.

Personally, I also wanted to use Val.town and SQLlite, and I found a simple bookmark tool, which I forked for this little project, that proved a great starting point to do so.

### How does it work?
Bookmarklets offer a simple way to extend the functionality of the browser. This is a simple, helpful guide to [learn more about bookmarklets and how/why to use them](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-bookmarklets/).

To get this working, you will need to fork [this val](https://www.val.town/v/juanca/bookmark), 
and include the `ENV vars` mentioned in the README.

You will also need a `FEEDBIN_TOKEN`, which you can get by logging in to your Feedbin account and navigating to `Feedbin > Settings > Pages > Bookmarklet`.
